Necessary classes: BuyShipFrame, Fightership, Main, Map, Mothership, Planet,
Player, SetKeysFrame, SettingsFrame, Ship, Warship

-Inheritance Hierarchy-
Fightership, Mothership, and Warship are objects inheriting from the
   abstract class of Ship.
Map inherites from the class JComponent.
Main, BuyShipFrame, SetKeysFrame, and SettingsFrame inherites from the

-Aggregation Hierarchy-
Main owns Map -> Map owns Ships which is an array of all ships, Map also owns 
   Objects which is an array of all objects.
Map controls -> SettingsFrame, SetKeysFrame, and BuyShipFrame frames

-Collaboration Relationships-
Main uses Map and it's public functions.
Map uses Ship and its subclasses, and also has listeners
   (mouse listeners and listening to whether the Main frame was resized).
Map also adds listeners to SettingsFrame SetKeysFrame, and BuyShipFrame 
components to know when to do certain operations.
Map uses Timer to do scheduled tasks in the Clock functions in the class.
Map also uses Player and Planet class to make objects and use them on the map.
Map detects collisions between objects.
