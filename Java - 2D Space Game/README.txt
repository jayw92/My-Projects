This is a project for one of my classes that I thought was interesting.

This uses the Java graphics and swing libraries and I made a space game.

This was an example of how to use GUI in JAVA, drawing 2D, and also abstracting classes and inheritance.

There is a UML Layout of this project provided in this directory as a PDF.
