This project is a side project I did in high school using NetBeans and Java.

It is not completed but I was using it as a way to learn about Java desktop apps and working with Files and also how I can make some file content secure using my own cryptography method, but clearly, the algorithm is not secure it was just a way to fool people who didn't know too much about encryption.
