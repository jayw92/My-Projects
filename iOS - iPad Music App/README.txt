I did this project for a iPad music apps course at Tufts in 2013.
This project is where I started working with iOS Development and I learned many things about Objective C, Crashlytics, music, notation, GitHub, etc.

This project is meant to be displayed on an iPad, it is not fully finished in terms of the functions we wished to have for it but it was a really large project for one semester and I learned a lot.
