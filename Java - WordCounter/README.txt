Total hours spent coding/testing/debugging: 2.5 hrs

Folders:
/dist/ - contains a .jar executable file distribution.
/src/ - contains a .java file that is the source of my project, can be used to compile if that is needed or for code reading purposes.

To use the program:
Just type into the textarea on the right side, fairly intuitive, and the right textarea will immediately analyze changes to the left textarea with counts and statistics.
